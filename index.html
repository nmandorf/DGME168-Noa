        <h2>California Climate</h2>
        <p>Like its topography, California’s climate is quite varied and extreme.
            Generally there are two seasons—a long, dry summer with low humidity
            and cool evenings, and a mild, rainy winter except in the high mountains,
            where four seasons prevail and snow lasts from November to April. The one
            consistent for the state is summer drought.</p>
        <p>The climate of California varies widely, from desert to subarctic,
            depending on latitude, elevation, and proximity to the coast. California’s
            coastal regions have a Mediterranean climate. </p>

        <h2>Climate Change</h2>
        <p>
            Climate change is having a profound impact on California’s water resources,
            as evidenced by changes in snowpack, sea level, and river flows.
        </p>
        <p>
            These changes are expected to continue in the future and more of our
            precipitation will likely fall as rain instead of snow. The predicted
            change in weather patterns will exacerbate other natural resource challenges
            for water supply. The mountain snowpack provides as much as a third of
            California’s water supply and accumulating snow during winter and its
            slow release during spring when we need it.
