        <h2>California Wildlife</h2>
        <p>California is one of the most biologically diverse places on the planet. And because our state is not
            only
            hemmed in by tall mountain ranges but surrounded by places that are significantly different in an
            ecological
            sense, the Golden State is isolated in many ways from the landscapes adjoining it.</p>
        <p>The list of California endemic animal species is long, and we've never found one not worth talking about.
            But
            for our purposes here, we have several species: mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and
            invertebrates. </p>

        <h2>Feeding Wildlife</h2>
        <p>While feeding wildlife makes those people doing so feel good, in the long run it is often to the
            detriment of
            the animal recipients. </p>
        <p>Although many animals will eat offered food, temporarily satisfying their hunger, in reality, many human
            foods lack the protein and nutritional
            components animals need for good health.When animals concentrate around food, they are more likely to
            spread
            diseases to each other and to domestic pets.
            When wild animals lose their natural fear of humans, they can become very aggressive. </p>
