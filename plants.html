        <h2>California Plants</h2>
        <p>California is one of the most diverse areas of the world. Within 5 hours
            or so of both nurseries you can drive to Death Valley or alpine tundra,
            ocean or conifer forest, vernal pools, alkali sinks, or grasslands.</p>
        <p>California is very diverse. Most of California gets no measurable rain from
            late April to November. This year we got almost all of the rain for the season
            in January. One month, that's it, and the native hillsides that are still intact
            look good. That makes many of our plants and animals unique.</p>

        <h2>Drought Tolerant Gardens</h2>
        <p>Native and drought tolerant plants are important for this region, not just because they are
            water efficient, but because they are the cornerstone of biological diversity and the
            foundations of the native ecosystems in our local Santa Monica Mountains environment. </p>
        <p>Using California-friendly plants for everything from backyard gardens to wide scale
            re-vegetation is a positive practice that will benefit the local habitat and all
            residents who live here. </p>
